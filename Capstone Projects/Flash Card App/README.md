# Flash Card App — Language Learning Tool

It displays French words and reveals the English translation after a timer. Unknown words are saved to a separate file so the user can review only the cards not yet mastered.

### 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (CSV handling)
- **Tkinter** (GUI)

### ✨ Features
- Randomized flash cards from a CSV file  
- Automatic flip after delay  
- “Known” and “Unknown” buttons to personalize learning  
- Persistent progress tracking using an updated CSV  

### 📂 Files
- `french_words.csv` — Original dataset  
- `words_to_learn.csv` — User progress  
- `main.py` — Application logic and GUI

### 🎯 Purpose
Hands-on practice combining **GUI development**, **file handling**, and **data manipulation**.
